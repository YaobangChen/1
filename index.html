            <h2>Review: Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti is a powerhouse—but good luck finding it at $1,199 MSRP</h2>
            <p>Nearly nine months ago, the RTX 3000 series of Nvidia graphics cards launched in a beleaguered world as a seeming ray of hope. The series' first two GPUs, the RTX 3080 and 3070, were nearly all things to all graphics hounds. Nvidia built these cards upon the proprietary successes of the RTX 2000 series and added sheer, every-API-imaginable rasterization power on top. An "RTX"-optimized game ran great on the line's opening salvo of the RTX 3080, sure, but even without streamlined ray tracing or the impressive upsampling of DLSS, it tera'ed a lot of FLOPs. Talk about a fun potential purchase for nerds trapped in the house. Even better, that power came along with more modest MSRPs compared to what we saw in the RTX 2000 series. As I wrote in September 2020: RTX 3080's. so, yeah. About that... At the time, I was too busy running benchmarks to ask my crystal ball about an imminent future of exploding crypto values and diminishing chip and silicon supplies. The graphics card market went kablooie, and that left me holding the bag of a ridiculous claim about future GPU prices. Anyone who's been paying attention has witnessed many instant GPU sell-outs and staggering eBay listings. Yet somehow, even though the series' existing cards are already difficult to track down, Nvidia's RTX 3000 series continues to expand—as seen in the recent announcement of two new models, the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti, which start at MSRPs of $1,199 and $599, respectively. (When fans asked you to make more graphics cards, Nvidia, I'm not sure this is what they meant.) If you're surprised by that news, you're not alone. Last week, I learned about the new models via an unannounced knock at the door and an 11-pound box, packed with one of each new GPU as provided by Nvidia. This is the first time I can recall getting a graphics card sample from a supplier without an email letting me know that I should prep my front porch's netting to catch eager cryptomining package thieves.</p>

            <h2>iPhone 13</h2>
            <p>The 2021 iPhone 13 models are still several months away from launching and are expected in September, but we've been hearing rumors about what to expect from the new devices since before the 2020 iPhone 12 models even debuted. The 2021 iPhone lineup will look similar to the 2020 iPhone lineup, with four devices in sizes that include 5.4-inches, 6.1-inches, and 6.7-inches, with two of the iPhones being higher-end "Pro" models and two positioned as lower-cost, more affordable devices. Major design changes are not expected, and 2021 iPhones will have the same feature set as the 2020 iPhones, but we can count on camera improvements, a faster A-series processor, a new 5G chip from Qualcomm, increased battery life, and some tweaks to the notch. There were rumors that at least one iPhone in 2021 would feature a portless design that relies entirely on wireless charging, but reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that's not going to happen. Apple is going to continue to rely on Lightning for the foreseeable future with no transition to USB-C and no portless design until MagSafe accessories are more common. We are expecting a smaller notch, and while some rumors suggested it could be shallower, device mockups based on information sourced from the Chinese supply chain indicate it will be smaller in size, taking up less space than the existing notch. Apple is also expected to introduce 120Hz refresh rates for Pro iPhone models, bringing the iPad Pro's ProMotion technology to the iPhone. Apple is said to be considering adding an in-display fingerprint sensor to the iPhone 13 models, which would be used in addition to Face ID as an alternate biometric authentication method, but it's not yet clear if this will happen. When it comes to improved camera technology, rumors suggest we could see the larger sensor in the iPhone 12 Pro Max extend to other models, along with the Sensor-Shift Stabilization feature for better auto-focus and stabilization across the lineup. There are rumored to be improvements to the Ultra Wide lenses on the "Pro" iPhone 13 models with lower apertures for better performance in low-light conditions and improved autofocus, but few changes are expected for the Wide lens in the devices.</p>
